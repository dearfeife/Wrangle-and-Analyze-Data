# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
<p> wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.
<p> WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I used Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.And store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file.
<P> There are three sources:
  <p>twitter_archive_enhanced.csv
  <p>image_predictions.tsv
  <p>tweet_json.txt
